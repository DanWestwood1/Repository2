## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems + natural numbers

#### Natural Numbers
**Definition**: Numbers which are countable.
**Examples**: 0,1,2,3,4

#### Real Numbers
**Definition**: Numbers which are possible
**Examples**: 0, 1.1, 2.1, -78
 
#### Rational Numbers
**Definition**: Numbers which can be represented as a fraction
**Examples**: 1/7, 2/9, 7/11

#### Irrational Numbers
**Definition**: Numbers which cannot be represented as a fraction
**Examples**: √2, √3

#### Ordinal Numbers
**Definition**: Numbers which represent the position of an item in a list

#### Integer Numbers
**Definition**: Whole numbers
**Examples**: 1,2,3,4,5

### 3.5.2 Number bases

#### Base 2
The binary number system as a whole.
Each _placement value_ is represented as a power of 2, unlike in denary, where it is represented as 10
These numbers can be denoted as 1010<sub>2</sub>. 
See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation

#### Base 10
The denary system
These numbers can be denoted as 16<sub>10</sub>.

#### Base 16
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi etc

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

#### unsigned binary
#### unsigned binary arithmetics
#### signed binary with two's complement
#### fixed point form binary representation of numbers with fractional parts

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
